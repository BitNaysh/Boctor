The itching can lead to sores and infections from scratching. Scabies is diagnosed by examining the skin and looking for burrows made by the mites. Treatment usually involves topical creams or lotions that kill the mites and their eggs. It is also important to wash all clothing, bedding, and towels in hot water and dry them on high heat to kill any mites that may be present.
